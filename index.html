    <p>Sunny days, <i>sweeping</i> up, clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get, how to get to <b>Sesame Street</b>. When the sun shines we'll shine together. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_%26_Lois" target="_blank">Ella ella ella a.</a> Imagine having everything you ever dreamed. Don't you want it. Maybe. Don't you see it? Kind of. Imagine first audition after college I get the lead. Well of course. Now you get it. You gotta believe. Down in the dark side.
